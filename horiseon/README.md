### Description:

This week's assignment is focused on increasing the accessibility of the `Horiseon` webpage , so it's optimized for all users and search engines.
Increasing the accessibility of a webpage allows browsers and search engines to read the content easier & faster, it also allows any other users with disabilities to use the website, making it benefit individuals, businesses, and society.

### Notes:
Optimizing content for better usage is a part that I still am new to it however, after reviewing the code and the webpage I've learned more than I knew before. I tried to see the content from a guest perspective and do my adjustments accordingly. This can be a simple webpage, but it showcases a lot of the features that web developers deal daily. I've noticed accessibility is a very important aspect on websites and writing clean, universal code that can be picked up anytime in the future and still continue where it has been left is another critical part in developing websites.

### Accessibility:
Many websites these days are developed with accessibility barriers making it almost impossible to suit every user that interacts with it. There are several aspects of achieving an accessible user interface within a website however, since we're only concerned with the `Horiseon` webpage, I will only point out the changes that are made which negatively effected the accessibility of this webpage;

1. Changed the title to **Horiseon** instead of **website**,
2. Changed side content **background color** for better contrast,
3. Added **alternate text** for images if they break down.

### Usage:
* Added comments to `index.html` and `style.css` files,
* Grouped the sections of elements for efficient code,
* Provided clean layout of the code for future usage.
